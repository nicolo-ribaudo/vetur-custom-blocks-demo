# Example of Vetur custom blocks

## DON'T USE THIS EXTENSION

Open `demo/` with this extension loaded, make some changes to `demo/.vscode/settings.json`
(you just need to add a space, because the grammar gets generated when that file changes).
Open `demo/example.vue` and you should see the correct highlighting.
